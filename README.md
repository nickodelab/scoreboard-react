## Project Description
This is a small project to learn the basis on react, better understanding of class vs. functional components, state and lifecycle methods, and how to split your UI into reusable and composable components. This code is made following the [teamtreehouse.com course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-components)

## Components description

- App: the main component and one of the few with state. I tried to mantein all the state and logic in App component.

- Counter: child of every Player component. Group the logic to sum or rest points.
- Header: component father of Stats and Timer.
- Icon: a little icon with binary behaviour to show a crown with the player name.
- Player: component to group the counter and the Icon Component.
- Stats: show the total number of stats
